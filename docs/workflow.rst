Workflow
========

The following should be the basic workflow:

1) look at paper
2) write JSON file
3) run verify script and check that it agrees with what you wrote
4) add contribution to ``done_papers_list.csv``
5) commit (and push if possible) changes


Common Problems
---------------

Problems with Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cannot write the feature, because...

    * ... it is obviously too complicated to write in a structured system: just give it a name starting with `__` (double underscore), which is descriptive of what it does
    * ... I see multiple ways of doing it with the current format specification: the features specification should not be ambiguous, so if this happens either there is something wrong with the specification (very likely), or you are misunderstanding something about it; report this to Daniel and/or open a ticket
    * ... I think it is possible to represent, but I am having trouble with it: ask for help, don't get stuck in something like this
