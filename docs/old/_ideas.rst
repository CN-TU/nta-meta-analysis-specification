Ideas for Future Work
=====================

.. todo:: should this be public?

* Check which features are more commonly used
* Find correlations between feature sets and authors/groups of authors (or academia vs industry)
* Allow "others" in metrics (FIV)
* Add "complexity" in metrics (FIV)
* Add "role" field to "methods". Options would be: "main" (part of the authors' proposal), "competitor" (used for comparison/benchmarking), "best" (the method that obtains the best performance in a comparison). Role admits more than one label, e.g., "role":["main","best"] (FIV)
* Separate "error_rate" metrics (FIV)
