Methods
=======

In this field you can put any methods the authors used, along with some properties.
This list is not yet very mature, so feel free to add to it (but *let everyone know* for example through an issue in Redmine).

.. include:: ../specification.txt
    :literal:
    :start-after: # method
    :end-before: # end
