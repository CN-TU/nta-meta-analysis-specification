Reference
=========

The reference part needs just enough information to uniquely identify the paper.
This is the main author name, title of the paper, and year it was published.

Definition:

.. include:: ../specification.txt
    :literal:
    :start-after: # reference
    :end-before: # end 

Example:

.. code-block:: none

  "reference": {
    "author": "Iglesias et al.", 
    "title": "Time-activity footprints in IP traffic", 
    "year": 2016
  }
