Repository Organization
=======================

We are currently in the process of converting all the v1 files into the latest version of our format.
This documentation includes the content for both versions, and the repository itself also supports both formats at the moment.
However, when we have converted all the files to the current version, the v1 files will be removed from the repository and documentation.

This is the current structure of the repository:

.. code-block:: none

    .
    ├── datasets.json           # v1 datasets
    ├── papers                  # v1 papers
    │   └── ...
    ├── tools.json              # v1 tools
    └── v2_papers               # papers in current version
        └── ...
